Create a file named login.php in your codeup.dev site. 
Add a form that accepts a username and password and have the form submit to the same page (login.php).
Create a file named authorized.php in your codeup.dev site. 
Add some HTML that simply says "Authorized" when it is viewed in the browser.
Add some PHP code to the top of the login page that checks the POST'ed username and password. 
If the username is equal to "guest" and the password is equal to "password" then redirect to the authorized.php. 
If the username and password do not match those values, show a login failed message on the login page.
